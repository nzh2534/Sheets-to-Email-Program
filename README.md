# Python Application for Sending Custom Emails to Donors

In order to send more custom emails above the Mailchimp cap for an organization, I created a custom solution to bypass this by:

⚡️ Pulling names and associated email address data using Google Sheets API  

📄 Formatting a custom email using HTML/CSS

📨 Sending out emails to all listed recipients using an SMTP GMAIL server

📦 Packaging the application as a distributable .exe for others to use
